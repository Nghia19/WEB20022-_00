        <h1>Typography</h1>
        <p>
          Let’s face it: the core purpose of all web design is communication.
          Whether we’re talking about an online retail store, a web presence for
          a Fortune 500 company, or a profile for a social networking site,
          typography is a vital component. For most people, typography is simply
          about arranging a fa-miliar set of shapes to make words, sentences,
          and paragraphs. Having the ability to set type with only a few strokes
          on a keyboard has allowed us to forget about the creative and artistic
          possibilities of this medium. There are numerous obstacles to the
          effective customization of typography for the Web—and I’ll address
          these in the coming pages—but the power of type should be motivation
          enough to push the proverbial envelope. Unconvinced? Pick up a
          magazine, turn on a television, or take a walk through a grocery
          store. You will undoubtedly see hundreds of creative and effective
          uses of type. It is the substance of branding, the key to unspoken
          communication, and an essential piece of the web design pie.

          Taking Type to the Web When it comes to theWeb and choosing fonts for
          text that will be displayed in a browser, it doesn’t matter if you
          have five, or 5,000, fonts installed; you have to think in terms of
          the lowest common denominator.
